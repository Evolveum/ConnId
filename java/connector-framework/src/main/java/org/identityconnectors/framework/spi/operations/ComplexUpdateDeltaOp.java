/**
 * <p>
 * Implementation of {@link UpdateDeltaOp with support for complex attribtues.
 * This operation updates the values in relative or absolute way. Modification
 * of each attribute is described by {@link AttributeDelta}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation is meant as a complete replacement of {@link UpdateDeltaOp} and
 * {@link UpdateAttributeValuesOp} that were poorly designed in the early
 * framework versions. The old operations have not provided any practical
 * way how to execute complex attribute changes in an efficient or atomic
 * way. The presence of a single operation in {@link UpdateOp} could not
 * support any kind of relative changes. The two operations added in
 * {@link UpdateAttributeValuesOp} did not really solve the problem either.
 * The fact that there are two operations made it impossible to implement
 * all scenarios due to operation ordering. E.g. invoking remove operation
 * first and add operation second will end up with an error when working
 * with mandatory multi-value attribute. On the other hand invoking add
 * operation first and remove operation second will cause issues with
 * attributes that represent some limited entitlements (e.g. groups that
 * may be assigned only once). Also the fact that the old update operations
 * returns just the Uid make it very hard to implement an efficient and
 * reliable connector. E.g. it is a common case that the name of the object
 * changes when some of the attributes are changed. The old update operations
 * provided no way how to indicate this change even if the connector was aware
 * of the change.
