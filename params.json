The toolkit is intended to facilitate development with as few dependences as possible.\r\n\r\n# Why ConnId?\r\nConnId's main purpose is to build a new home for the [Identity Connectors project](http://java.net/projects/identityconnectors/), \r\nwith all that is required nowadays for a modern Open Source project: Apache Maven driven build, artifacts and \r\nmailing lists.\r\n\r\n# Is this Open Source?\r\nAll the code and documentation are released under terms of \r\n[CCDL 1.0](https://raw.github.com/Tirasa/ConnIdBase/master/legal/license.txt).\r\n\r\n# What is ConnId meant for?\r\nOne of the main features of the framework is decoupling Connectors from any application that uses them. \r\nThis means each Connector implementation can be easily replaced and not necessarily depend on a specific version \r\nof the framework. In addition an application may choose to use multiple Connectors which can require class path \r\nisolation. With class path isolation there is no issue with conflicting 3rd party libraries.\r\nAn application is only required to couple to the Framework and not to any specific Connector.\r\n\r\n![ConnId architecture](https://raw.github.com/Tirasa/ConnIdBase/master/images/architecture.png \"ConnId architecture\")\r\n","name":"ConnId","tagline":"ConnId (Connectors for Identity Management) is built to help drive development of Connectors.","google":"UA-16125365-3"}
